  I know the spec called for a max container of 1200px, but tailwind ships with some
  quality default widths out of the box and `max-w-7xl` is 1280px, which is close enough
  for me.  If you _really_ wanted, you could make it 1200px using the commented out line
  instead, but that might start to collide with other tailwind provided utility classes
  later, so be careful.

  you might be tempted / confused about this vs using a breakpoint.  Remember, breakpoints
  are for when you want to change your layout.  Here, we just want to constrain our max 
  width.  Nothing CSS wise changes between on screens > 1280

  You could also completely rewrite the provided tailwind theme to match your design spec,
  but that's not something I wanted to get into for this project :-)
